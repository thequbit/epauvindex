==========

set of tools for scraping and interfacing with EPA UV Index data

Working example can be seen here: [Daily EPA UV Index Heat Map] (http://mycodespace.net/projects/epauvindex/)

There are some bugs with the heatmap javascript library I used ... or how I am using it (one of those ... :p).  If it doesn't display, zoom in or out again and it should show up.
